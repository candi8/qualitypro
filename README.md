# 🚀 Beginner Tutorial: How to Edit This GitHub Pages Website (No Coding Required)

This guide is made for **total beginners** — no coding, no Git knowledge needed.
You will learn **exactly how to edit the site** stored in this repository.

The website files are inside this folder:
`index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `style.css`, `header.html`, `footer.html`, etc.

---

## 📘 Quick Glossary (Super Simple)

* **GitHub** → Website where project files are stored.
* **Repository (repo)** → A project folder on GitHub.
* **GitHub Pages** → Turns these files into a live website.
* **Fork** → Your personal copy of the project so you can edit safely.

# 🟢 Workflow A — Easiest Method: Edit a File Directly in the Browser

Best for small changes (text on a page, contact info, titles).

### 1. Sign in to GitHub

If you don’t have an account, create one at **github.com**.

### 2. Go to the project

Open:
**[https://github.com/candi8/qualitypro](https://github.com/candi8/qualitypro)**

### 3. Open the file you want to edit

For example:

* `index.html` → homepage
* `about.html` → About page
* `style.css` → website styling

### 4. Click the **✏️ pencil icon** (top right)

This opens the editor directly inside your browser.

### 5. Make your change

Look for the text you want to modify.

Example:

```html
<h1>Old Title</h1>
```

Change to:

```html
<h1>New Title</h1>
```

⚠️ **Important:** Only edit the text between the tags — keep the `< >` parts untouched.

### 6. Save your change (Commit)

Scroll to the bottom:

* Write a message like: `Updated homepage title`
* GitHub will propose creating a **new branch** → accept it
* Click **Commit changes**

If you don’t own the repo, GitHub will automatically create a **fork** (your safe copy).

### 7. View your live website

Go to:
**Settings → Pages**
You will see the website URL.

Changes usually appear in **less than 1 minute**.

# 🔵 Workflow B — More Powerful (Still Easy): Use GitHub.dev VS Code Editor

Best if you want to edit multiple files.

### 1. Open the repo

Visit:
[https://github.com/candi8/qualitypro](https://github.com/candi8/qualitypro)

### 2. Press **`.` (dot)** on your keyboard

This opens the project in a VS Code-like editor inside your browser.

### 3. Edit multiple files

Click any file, update text, and press **Ctrl+S** (or Save).

### 4. Commit (save)

Use the left “Source Control” panel to **Commit** your changes.

GitHub will still create a fork and branch automatically if needed.

### 5. View the live website

Go to: **Settings → Pages** to see the site URL.

---

# 🧩 What Files Control What?

* **index.html** → Home page
* **about.html** → About page
* **services.html** → Services page
* **style.css** → Colors, fonts, spacing
* **header.html** → Top of every page
* **footer.html** → Bottom of every page
* **CNAME** → Custom domain (don’t edit unless you know what it does)

# ✏️ Quick Examples You Can Copy–Paste

### Change a headline:

```html
<h1>Quality Pro</h1>
```

Replace with:

```html
<h1>QualityPro — Updated</h1>
```

### Change text paragraph:

```html
<p>We offer top-quality services.</p>
```

Replace with:

```html
<p>We proudly deliver high-quality professional services.</p>
```

### Change email or phone:

Look for something like:

```html
<a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a>
```

Change the text and/or email address.

# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**I don’t see changes on the live site**
→ Wait 30–60 seconds and refresh.
→ Check **Settings → Pages** to confirm the publishing branch.

**I can’t find the edit (✏️) button**
→ Make sure you are **logged in**.
→ If you don’t have permissions, GitHub will automatically create a **fork**.

**I’m afraid of breaking something**
→ Don’t worry — everything you edit happens in your personal copy unless merged by the project owner.

# 🎉 You’re Done!

You now know how to edit, update, and publish changes to a GitHub Pages site — even with **zero developer experience**.

If you want me to format this in a different style (shorter, more visual, with emojis removed, etc.), just ask!
